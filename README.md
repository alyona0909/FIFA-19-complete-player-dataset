# Predicting the ovarall player's rating base on FIFA-19-complete-player-dataset

In this notebook, we're going to create a machine learning project with the goal of predicting the ovarall player's rating.

## Data 

The data we're using is from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19

`data.csv` contains detailed attributes for every player registered in the latest edition of FIFA 19 database.

This file is a machine learning project. 

Before modeling, we'll parse all input data.

We're using to models for describing regression problem:
1. ElasticNet
2. RandomForestRegressor
